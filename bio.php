		<h1>Biography</h1>

		<p>
			I am a freelance proofreader, copy-editor and copywriter with many years of experience 
			in a number of different fields and industries.<br><br>

			I have both academic and professional experience which has provided me with a wide skill set 
			and a more flexible approach. After 10 years in higher education I hold a BA Joint Honours in 
			History and Ancient History, a Masterâ€™s (Research) and an MPhil in History which has supplied 
			me with invaluable experience relating to written and verbal communications, editing, 
			time management, attention to detail and accuracy as well as development in analytical research. 
			On top of my academics I hold the Cambridge CELTA for teaching English as a foreign language 
			which has further complimented my use and knowledge of the language, and an accredited 
			CMP Diploma in Copywriting.<br><br>

			My 3rd degree was undertaken part-time whilst working and so as well as developing the ability 
			to juggle many projects and work well under pressure it meant that I was able to gain 
			professional work experience in a number of industries, including HR, finance, economics and 
			technology. I have regularly undertaken proofreading and copy-editing in various forms for 
			each organisation, as well as an increasing amount of copywriting. My current role is in 
			marketing communications, where I regularly write content for the company website and act 
			as content editor for the newsletter and company blog.<br><br>
			
			Alongside these positions I work as a freelancer for small companies, start-ups and individuals, providing proofreading and editing services as well as written content when required. I love this type of work and am at my happiest when doing it.
